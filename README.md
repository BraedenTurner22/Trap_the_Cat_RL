#Trap the Cat RL

Current project. Re-creating one of my favorite childhood games, Trap the Cat, and creating a player agent trained through reinforcement learning to master the game.

Currently building the cat using A* pathfinding.

Much credit goes to Thomas Rush and his implementation of the A* algorithm:
